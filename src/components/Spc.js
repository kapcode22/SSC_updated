                        Social projects club , is a group of innovative young individuals
                        operating in collaboration with the Social Service Council of IIT
                        (BHU), Varanasi. We address a range of societal concerns, employing
                        our technical expertise, meticulous planning, and strategic thinking
                        to devise innovative solutions. As a united team, we've embraced the
                        task of empowering society through simple and impactful approaches.
                        The "Social Projects Club" aims to make a meaningful impact on
                        society by employing dedicated and systematic approaches to explore
                        various underlying factors contributing to societal decline. Through
                        this diligent process, the club strives to identify distinct causes
                        for these issues and subsequently devises comprehensive strategies
                        to address them effectively, leading to meaningful solutions.
